                <h3>Educate yourself about BGP</h3>
                <p>Our free BGP tunnel offering is available for any individual which would like to start using BGP for
                    educational or research purposes. All our tunnels are based on GRE, offer a full table of IPv6
                    routes and accept trusted / verified announcements based on IRR data within the RIPE database.</p>
                <p>Thanks to our automation platform we can quickly spin up new tunnels without much administrative
                    overhead and are able to update our route filters daily to ensure a secure and trusted environment
                    without risking to cause any negative impact on the global routing tables.</p>
                <p>Please note that for policy and verification purposes we only accept the announcement of resources
                    registered to the RIPE database. Should you not own an ASN and/or IP space yet, feel free to take a
                    look at our competitively priced <a href="{{< ref "/services/ripe.html" >}}">RIPE LIR services</a>
                    to
                    get started.</p>

                    Each free BGP tunnel we are offering to a customer causes monthly operational costs on our side,
                    which is why we are forced to restrict the usage of them to strictly educational and research
                    purposes. Please make sure you fulfill all requirements before requesting access to our service.

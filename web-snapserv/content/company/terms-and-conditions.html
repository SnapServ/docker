            apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you

        </p>

        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be
            asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit
            card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.
        </p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment
            method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct
            and complete.</p>
        <p>By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide the information to third parties for
            purposes of facilitating the completion of Purchases. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at
            any time for certain reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the
            description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons. We reserve the right
            to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorised or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

        <h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>
        <p>We are constantly updating our offerings of products and services on the Service. The products or services
            available on our Service may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience
            delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites.</p>
        <p>We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product
            images, specifications, availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or update information and
            to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in
            advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or
            annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
            unless you cancel it or SnapServ Mathis cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
            your online account management page or by contacting SnapServ Mathis customer support team.</p>

        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your
            Subscription. You shall provide SnapServ Mathis with accurate and complete billing information including
            full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting
            such payment information, you automatically authorize SnapServ Mathis to charge all Subscription fees
            incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, SnapServ Mathis will issue an electronic invoice
            indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
            corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

        <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
        <p>SnapServ Mathis, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the
            Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing
            Cycle. SnapServ Mathis will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to
            give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued
            use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the
            modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current
            at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination
            of your account on our Service. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the
            Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or
            a third-party service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us
            immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the
            Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the
            Service.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall SnapServ Mathis, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates,
            be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without
            limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access

            legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy
            set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

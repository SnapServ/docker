                            Tor is network software that helps users to enhance their privacy, security, and safety
                            online. It protects users against hazards such as harassment, spam, and identity theft. We
                            are running a entry/middle relay since more than two years to support the Tor project. You
                            can find our relay with detailed statistics on <a

                            We run an instance of the ArchiveTeam Warrior, which is a virtual appliance contributing to
                            the efforts of the ArchiveTeam to preserve our digital heritage. It will automatically
                            collect and scrape websites and otherwise publicly available data which is at risk of being
                            shut down in the near future.

                            We run our own privacy-focussed Jabber server called CORE.mx, where anyone can freely
                            register to start chatting over a secure and open protocol. Our server follows all current
                            best practices and offers a wide set of features. You can find further information about
                            this project on its dedicated website at <a href="https://core.mx"

                            We understand the importance of open source projects and actively participate at GitHub by
                            publishing various parts of our infrastructure as well as other fun projects to the world,
                            which can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/snapserv" target="_blank">GitHub
